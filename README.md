# Uv_Map_Creation_Tool

Inaccurate UV maps can result, especially when combining mesh. They do not reveal themselves until the light bake process. Remember, real-time light calculations don't need UV maps. Fixing wrong UV maps can be very annoying. "Uv Map Creation Tool" quickly and very easily creates a UV map for your models.
It is very simple to use, it is enough to explain with a small gif.
